# Story 1.1 â€“ MiniPay SDK Integration

**User Story:**  
As a developer,  
I want to integrate the MiniPay SDK into the mini-app,  
so that the app can access wallet balance, send transactions, and fetch MSISDN if supported.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. SDK integrated successfully in mini-app.  
2. User wallet balance displayed.  
3. User MSISDN retrieved automatically if SDK supports it.  
4. If not available, flag set for manual entry in later flows.
