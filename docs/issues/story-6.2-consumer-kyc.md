# Story 6.2 â€“ Consumer KYC (Threshold-Based)

**User Story:**  
As a system operator,  
I want to trigger KYC for consumers over thresholds,  
so that compliance balances convenience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Minimal info required initially.  
2. KYC triggered if payments > threshold.  
3. Docs captured via app flow.  
4. Threshold configurable.
