# Story 1.4 â€“ Security & Logging Baseline

**User Story:**  
As a system operator,  
I want baseline security + logging in place,  
so that early security and auditability requirements are met.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. API endpoints secured with authentication/authorization.  
2. Logs capture request/response metadata (no sensitive data).  
3. Sensitive data (MSISDN, KYC docs, keys) stored encrypted.  
4. Audit trail created for all SDK + backend calls.
