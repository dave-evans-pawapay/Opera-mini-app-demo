As a system operator,  
I want to convert stablecoins to local fiat,  
so that payouts can be processed via PawaPay.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Conversion via off-ramp/liquidity provider.  
2. Rates and fees logged/displayed.  
3. Errors retried or flagged.  
4. Fiat equivalent stored in transaction record.
