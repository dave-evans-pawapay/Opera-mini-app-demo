# Story 6.4 â€“ Security Hardening

**User Story:**  
As a developer,  
I want strong security controls,  
so that user data and funds are protected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Encrypt data at rest/in transit.  
2. Secrets managed in secure vault.  
3. Role-based access enforced.  
4. Pen-test before launch.
