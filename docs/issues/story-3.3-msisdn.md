# Story 3.3 â€“ MSISDN Capture

**User Story:**  
As a consumer,  
I want my MSISDN linked to my payment,  
so that PawaPay can reconcile with my mobile identity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MSISDN auto-retrieved if SDK supports it.  
2. If unavailable, user prompted for manual entry.  
3. MSISDN validated (format, country code).  
4. MSISDN securely attached to transaction record.
