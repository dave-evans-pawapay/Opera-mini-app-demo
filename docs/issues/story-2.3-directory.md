# Story 2.3 â€“ Merchant Directory (Consumer View)

**User Story:**  
As a consumer,  
I want to browse/search a directory of merchants in MiniPay,  
so that I can select the correct merchant when making a payment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Search by merchant name or ID.  
2. Directory shows name, category, logo/icon, and location.  
3. Only approved merchants visible.  
4. Selecting merchant pre-fills payment form.
