As a merchant,  
I want to see the status of my settlements,  
so that I know whether funds are pending, completed, or failed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Backend listens for PawaPay callbacks.  
2. Status updates reflected in dashboard.  
3. Pending settlements retried if transient failure.  
4. Failures flagged with reason codes.
